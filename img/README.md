DIGIT TEMPLATE INSTRUCTIONS
===========================

Place individual digit images here:
- 1.png (image of digit "1" from the game)
- 2.png (image of digit "2" from the game)
- 3.png (image of digit "3" from the game)
- 4.png (image of digit "4" from the game)
- 5.png (image of digit "5" from the game)
- 6.png (image of digit "6" from the game)
- 7.png (image of digit "7" from the game)
- 8.png (image of digit "8" from the game)
- 9.png (image of digit "9" from the game)

HOW TO CREATE TEMPLATES:
1. Take a screenshot of your game with clear numbers
2. Crop out individual digits (just the number, as small as possible)
3. Save them as 1.png, 2.png, etc. in this folder
4. Make sure the images are clean and match the style in the game
5. The app will automatically load and use these templates

TIPS:
- Use high-quality screenshots
- Crop tightly around each digit
- All templates should be roughly the same size
- PNG format with transparency works best
